When working on a big scaled application, sometimes you want to load and asynchronously instantiate part of it. If you worked on a big client-side application with a bundler like Webpack, you probably know how [code-splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) works.

If you read about Injex's [Webpack Runtime](/docs/runtimes/webpack), you noticed that we use the `require.context()` to load the files inside the project. The problem with this approach is that we're bundling all the code together.

With the `@lazy()` decorator you create a class that implements the [`ILazyModule`](/docs/api/core/enums-interfaces#ilazymodule) interface. The `import` method should load and return a Constructor inside a Promise, then the constructor is called with args you pass in. You can use the `import` method for lazy-loading the code.

## Usage

To use the `@lazy()` decorator, put it above an exported class that implements the [`ILazyModule`](/docs/api/core/enums-interfaces#ilazymodule) interface. Lines 9 and 11 will create a chunk using Webpack's code-splitting feature.

```ts {4,9,11}
import { define, lazy, ILazyModule, IConstructor } from "@injex/core";

@define()
@lazy()
export class CreatePage implements ILazyModule<IPage> {
    public async import(pageType: "home" | "profile"): Promise<IConstructor<IPage>> {
        switch(pageType) {
            case "home":
                return (await import("./pages/home")).HomePage;
            case "profile":
                return (await import("./pages/profile")).ProfilePage;
        }
    }
}
```

```ts title="home.ts"
export class HomePage {
    @inject() private env;

    ...
}
```

Notice how the lazy-loaded class (HomePage) not defined by the `@define()` decorator since it's get registered when loaded by the `@lazy()` module, but it's not preventing you from using the `@inject()`, `@injectAlias()`, `@init()` decorators.
